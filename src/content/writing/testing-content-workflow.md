# Testing the Git Submodule Content Workflow

This article is a test to verify that our Git submodule content management system is working correctly from end to end.

## What We're Testing

1. **Content Creation**: Adding a new article to the submodule
2. **Local Development**: Verifying it appears in the dev server
3. **Deployment Pipeline**: Ensuring it gets deployed to production
4. **URL Generation**: Checking clean URLs are generated

## The Workflow

The complete workflow involves:

1. Create content in the `meaningfool-writing` repository
2. Commit and push to the writing repository  
3. Update the submodule reference in the main site
4. Deploy the updated site

## Expected Results

If this workflow is successful, you should see:
- ✅ This article listed on the homepage
- ✅ Clean URL: `/articles/testing-content-workflow`
- ✅ Proper rendering with title, date, and content
- ✅ Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages

## Conclusion

This test validates that the Git submodule approach provides a clean separation between content and code while maintaining a smooth publishing workflow.
