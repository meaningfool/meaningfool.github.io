# Building Static Sites with Astro

Astro is a modern static site generator that focuses on shipping less JavaScript to create faster websites. It's perfect for content-heavy sites like blogs and documentation.

## Key Features

### Zero JavaScript by Default
Astro ships zero JavaScript by default, only adding it when you explicitly need interactivity.

### Component Islands
You can use components from any framework (React, Vue, Svelte) as "islands" of interactivity.

### File-based Routing
Pages are created by adding files to the `src/pages/` directory, making site structure intuitive.

## Content Collections

Astro's content collections feature makes it easy to work with markdown content:

```javascript
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';

const articles = defineCollection({
  type: 'content',
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    date: z.date(),
    description: z.string(),
  }),
});
```

This approach provides type safety and excellent developer experience when working with content.
