# Getting Started with Git Submodules

Git submodules are a powerful way to manage content separately from your main codebase. This approach is particularly useful for static sites where you want to separate content management from site development.

## Why Use Submodules?

- **Separation of concerns**: Keep content separate from code
- **Independent workflows**: Writers can focus on content without touching code
- **Version control**: Full history tracking for both content and site changes
- **Team collaboration**: Different teams can work on content vs. site features

## Basic Workflow

1. Create content in the submodule repository
2. Update the main site to pull latest content
3. Deploy with updated content

This approach scales well for blogs, documentation sites, and content-heavy applications.
