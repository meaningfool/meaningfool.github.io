			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>🏁 Customer success is the goal. (Productized) software may be solution. And it may not. Whatever works</p>
			<p>👂 Actively listening is where it all starts and ends.</p>
			<p>⚙️ "Perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take away." is the rightful defintion of a solution / system</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>🐥 I'm the father of 1, and when I get away, I'm probably bikepaching 🚴‍♂️, or sailing ⛵.</p>
			<p>👨‍🚀 What get's me going: solving problems, learning, exploring / pioneering a field.</p>
			<p>🗺️ AI is clearing the map. I'm out there trying to make sense of the new landscape. In public</p>
			<h1>Work with me</h1>
			<p>👨‍💻 I mainly do freelance product manager work.</p>
			<p>💥 But if you think I could be a unique fit for a permanent position, please reach out.</p>
