			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>🏁 Customer success is the goal. The product is one of the means. I remain deeply influenced by my early days as a CSM, so I'm have very much a "whatever works / whatever needs to be done"-approach to solving customer problems.</p>
			<p>👂 Also, in that role, I could not change the product, so I embraced actively listening to customers, to surgically isolate the problemn and come up with workarounds and frugal solutions.</p>
			<p>⚙️ But I'm also an engineer by trade, and opportunities arise where problems meet solutions. I enjoy building elegant, stripped down (think of St Exupery's quote about perfection) systems.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>🐥 I'm the father of 1, and when I get away, I'm probably bikepaching 🚴‍♂️, or sailing ⛵.</p>
			<p>👨‍🚀 What get's me going is: solving problems, learning, exploring / pioneering a field.</p>
			<p>🗺️ But if I am an explorer, I'm of the sort that is drawing up a map on the way. Success needs to be reproduceable.</p>
			<h1>Work with me</h1>
			<p>👨‍💻 I mainly do freelance product manager work.</p>
			<p>💥 But if you think I could be a unique fit for a permanent position, please reach out.</p>
