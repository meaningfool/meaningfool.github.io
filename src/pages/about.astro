			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>🏁 I started my career in customer facing roles (consulting, customer success), and moved on to product management.</br>
			👂 I kept the eagerness to listen and deeply understand the context and problems.</br>
			🔪Understanding, to me, means empathizing, but also cutting open, dissecting methodologically.</p>	
			<p>🎓 As my career progressed, I found myself going back to what I was educated to be: an engineer who designs and builds solutions.</br>
			🔹 What's the minimalistic concept architecture that will match the customers / users' needs and mental models? </br>
			🤯 I enjoy engaging with complexity (tech, business, regulatory…) so that the users don't have to.</p>
			<p>🏗️ The most recent development of my career "shifting right" is me learning to build things myself.</br>
			🤖 I'm leveraging AI to bridge the gap, and documenting the process as I'm going.</p>
			<h1>Work with me</h1>
			<p>👨‍💻 I mainly do freelance product manager work.</br>
			💥 But if you think I could be a unique fit for a permanent position, please reach out.</p>
