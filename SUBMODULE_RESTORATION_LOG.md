# Git Submodule Restoration Progress Log

**Goal**: Restore Git submodules approach for content management
**Started**: 2025-09-09
**Status**: In Progress

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have
- Main repository: `meaningfool.github.io` 
- Content as regular files in: `src/content/writing/`
- Content repository exists: `meaningfool-writing`
- GitHub Actions workflows configured for submodules

### What We Need
- Convert `src/content/writing/` from regular files to Git submodule
- Test and verify deployment pipeline works
- Document what works and what doesn't

## Phase 1: Investigation and Backup

### Step 1.0: Safety First - Branch Creation
**DECISION**: Create feature branch before any changes
- ✅ This allows safe experimentation
- ✅ Easy rollback if issues occur
- ✅ Clean PR workflow when ready

### Step 1.1: Current Content Inventory
**Current state on main branch:**
- Content files exist as regular files in `src/content/writing/`
- Files: `sample-article-1.md`, `sample-article-2.md`, `testing-content-workflow.md`
- No `.gitmodules` file present
- GitHub Actions workflows configured for submodules already
